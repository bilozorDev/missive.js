import { Steps, Aside, Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Missive.js includes a powerful middleware system in each bus to process intents (`command`, `query`, and `event`) in a flexible and extendable manner. 
Middleware allows you to insert cross-cutting concerns such as validation, logging, authentication, error handling, and more into the 
processing pipeline without duplicating code across individual handlers. This makes it easy to maintain and scale your application while keeping 
business logic clean and separated.

## How middleware works

Middleware in Missive.js works similarly to middleware in other JavaScript frameworks like Express, Koa or Fastify. Each middleware function wraps around the 
processing of an intent, giving you control over the flow and transformation of the intent as it moves through the service bus. 

Bus Missive.js has its concept of _Envelope_ and _Stamps_, which are used to pass data and metadata between middlewares and handlers, allowing you to 
inject additional information or context into the processing pipeline.

Here's how it works:

<Steps>
1. Intent Dispatch

    When an intent is dispatched to the service bus, it is immediately wrapped in an _Envelope_.

2. Middleware Execution

    The _Envelope_ passes through each middleware sequentially. Each middleware function receives the intent wrapped in the _Envelope_ and a reference to 
    the next function, which calls the next middleware or the handler in the chain.

    Middleware can, for instance, do the following:
        - Inspect the intent and its _Envelope_.
        - Transform or add _Stamps_ to the intent or its _Envelope_.
        - Validate the intent's data or context before it reaches the handler.
        - Log the intent's details for monitoring or auditing purposes.
        - Handle errors by catching exceptions from downstream middlewares or the handler.

    There is no limit:
     - to the number of middlewares you can add to a bus, allowing you to create complex processing pipelines with ease.
     - to what you can do with a middleware

3. Handler Execution

    After the intent passes through all the middleware, it reaches the handler defined for the specific intent type. The handler processes the intent based on
    its business logic and _Stamps_ `handled` is added to the envelope.

</Steps>

## Creating Middleware

Middleware functions in Missive.js are simple, functions that take in two parameters:

- an _Intent_ wrapped in the _Envelope_: te current intent being processed.
- _next_: A function that calls the next middleware or handler in the pipeline.

Here's an example middleware function:
```typescript
async (envelope, next) => {
    console.log('Logger Middleware: Message Received', envelope.message);
    await next();
    console.log('Logger Middleware: Message Handled', envelope.message);
}
```

### Using Middleware

To use middleware in Missive.js, you attach it to the service bus when configuring it. 
Middleware functions are applied in the order they are added, forming a processing pipeline.

```typescript
const myMiddleware = createMyMiddleware<'query', QueryHandlerRegistry>();
const queryBus = createQueryBus<QueryHandlerRegistry>();
queryBus.use(loggerMiddleware);
```

You can also use the built-in middleware in a simpler way

```typescript
const queryBus: QueryBus = createQueryBus<QueryHandlerRegistry>();
queryBus.useLoggerMiddleware();
queryBus.useCacherMiddleware();
queryBus.useLockMiddleware({ getLockKey: (envelope) => envelope.message.id });
queryBus.use(myMiddleware);
```

## Best Practices

- **Order Matters**: Middlewares are executed in the order they are registered. Place essential middleware, early in the chain to prevent 
   invalid or unauthorized intents from reaching the handler.
- **Keep Middleware Focused**: Each middleware should handle one concern to keep the pipeline clean and maintainable.
- **Mutation**: Avoid mutating the intent or its _Envelope_ in a middleware unless necessary. Instead, use _Stamps_ to pass data between middlewares and handlers.

## Summary

Middleware in Missive.js offers a powerful and flexible way to manage the flow of intents through your system. By inserting middleware into 
the pipeline, you can centralize cross-cutting concerns like validation, logging, and error handling, ensuring that your codebase remains modular, 
clean, and easy to scale.

With these principles in mind, you can build a robust, maintainable architecture that allows for complex scenarios like retry policies, detailed logging,
and consistent validation across your entire application.

## Built-in Middlewares are `intent` aware

Every single built-in middleware can be configured to be `intent` aware. This means that you can have a different configuration for each intent type.

```typescript
const queryBus: QueryBus = createQueryBus<QueryHandlerRegistry>();
queryBus.useCacherMiddleware({
    ...defaultOptions
    intents: {
        YouQueryCommandEventType: {
            ...specificOptions
        },
    },
})
```

## Breaking the Chain (of middlewares) <Badge text='advanced' variant='danger'/>

In some situations, you may want to stop the processing of an intent before it reaches the handler. Indeed, if a middleware function does not call the `next` function,
the chain middleware will be broken, and the intent will not be processed further.

This is really convenient for performance for instance, but it is not always what you want to do.
For this reason the bus will never handle an intent that has been handled already. It does that information thanks to the `missive:handled` stamp.

Within the built-in middlewares, here is the list of the ones where you have the option to break the chain. _(default: yes)_:
- [**CacherMiddleware**](/missive.js/built-in-middlewares/cacher): if the intent has been cached.
- [**FeatureFlagMiddleware**](/missive.js/built-in-middlewares/feature-flag): if the intent has been handled by a _fallbackHandler_.
- [**AsyncMiddleware**](/missive.js/built-in-middlewares/async): when the envelope is sent to a queue.
