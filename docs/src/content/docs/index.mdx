## Why did we build Missive.js?

We love clean architecture and CQRS, we didn't find any simple Service Bus that fits our needs. More details in the [full article](/missive.js/why).

        Define your `query`, `command` or `event` using a [Zod schema](https://zod.dev) for validation and type

        Can we call it a Service Bus without Middlewares? _(we don't)_. Register middlewares to leverage the full power

## In a nutshell

<Steps>

1. Install it

    <Install />

2. Define your handler for `query`, `command` or `event` using a [Zod schema](https://zod.dev) for validation and type inference.

    <CreateHandler />

3. Create a `bus` instance with all your definitions

    <DefineBus />

4. Dispatch an intent

    <Dispatch />

</Steps>

## Built-in Middlewares

Those are the built-in [middlewares](/missive.js/guides/middlewares) that you can use out of the box. They are all optional and you can use them all together or just the ones you need.
Middlewares provides a way to handle cross-cutting concerns. They are key to keep your code clean and maintainable.
And most of all, they are easy to write and to use, and they can be generic!

That's the power of Missive.js! Here are the built-in middlewares:

<CardGrid>
    <Card title="Logger Middleware" icon="bars">
        <p>Easily add observability to your application by logging the messages (intent) and the full Envelope (with the Stamps) before and 
        once handled (or errored) in the backend of your choice.</p>
        <LinkButton href={'/missive.js/built-in-middlewares/logger'} variant="secondary" class="float-right" title={"Read the doc about the Logger Middleware"}>Read the doc</LinkButton>
    </Card>
    <Card title="Caching Middleware" icon="approve-check-circle">
        <p>Caches results for faster access in future queries, reducing load and making it blazing fast.</p>
        <LinkButton href={'/missive.js/built-in-middlewares/cacher'} variant="secondary" class="float-right" title={"Read the doc about the Cacher Middleware"}>Read the doc</LinkButton>
    </Card>

    <Card title="Retry Middleware" icon="random">
        <p>Automatically retries processing a message a specified number of times before considering it as failed, with a backoff strategy.</p>
        <LinkButton href={'/missive.js/contributing'} variant="secondary" class="float-right" ><Badge text='coming soon' variant='caution'/></LinkButton>
    </Card>

    <Card title="Async Middleware" icon="seti:nunjucks">
        <p>You can already do async if you don't _await_ in your handler, but this is next level. Push the intent to a queue and handle it asynchronously.</p>
        <p>Missive.js will provide the consumer which is going to be smart enough to handle the async processing.</p>
        <LinkButton href={'/missive.js/contributing'} variant="secondary" class="float-right" ><Badge text='coming soon' variant='caution'/></LinkButton>
    </Card>

    <Card title="Lock Middleware" icon="seti:lock">
        <p>It provide a way to lock the processing of a message based on something in the intent itself. For instance your could lock the `command` that touches a Cart.</p>
        <LinkButton href={'/missive.js/contributing'} variant="secondary" class="float-right" ><Badge text='coming soon' variant='caution'/></LinkButton>
    </Card>

    <Card title="Webhook Middleware" icon="rocket">
        <p> The Webhook Middleware is going to push the result(s) of handlers(s) to confirured webhook(s). It's another way to decouple your system and to make it more resilient.</p>
        <LinkButton href={'/missive.js/contributing'} variant="secondary" class="float-right" ><Badge text='coming soon' variant='caution'/></LinkButton>
